## 🛠️ What We Do

We develop a complete suite of trading technology:

- 🤖 **Trading Bots**  
  Automated systems that execute user-created strategies across multiple brokers and markets.

- 📊 **Technical Indicators**  
  Customizable technical analysis tools integrated across the platform.

- 🔌 **Market Data Engines**  
  Real-time and historical data pipelines using WebSocket multi-exchange feeds.

- 🧠 **Smart Trading Systems**  
  Pattern recognition, signal engines, and algorithmic decision logic.

- 🔍 **Backtesting & Strategy Builder**  
  A visual environment where users build, test, and deploy automated strategies.  
  *(Automated bots are now developed directly inside this repository based on user strategies.)*

- 🌐 **Unified Web Platform**  
  The **pip-matrix** website connects all tools in one interface — charting, strategy creation, backtesting, automation, and broker integration.
